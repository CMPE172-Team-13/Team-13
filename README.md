## Project Introduction
This application is a three tier web application that simulates the blood donation process. Users are able to virtually “donate” blood at particular donation sites. The user can then track their blood donation and learn details about its journey such as where it is stored after the donation and which hospital receives the donation. Users will be able to view analytics such as the capacity of the hospitals, which hospitals receive the most of a certain blood type, and which donation sites receive the most donations. The project showcases various components that were introduced in CMPE 172 and sheds some light on the process that goes into donating blood.

## UI Data Transport
JSON is used as the data transport format between the server and client.
